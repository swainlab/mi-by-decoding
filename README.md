# mi-by-decoding

Matlab and R scripts for estimating mutual information by decoding stochastic time series data.

These scripts implement the mutual information estimation algorithm as described in Granados, et al. (2018) Distributed and dynamic intracellular organization of extracellular information. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1716659115. The algorithm enables estimation of a lower bound on the mutual information between time series and conditions, that is, where the data are sets of stochastic time series sampled for a finite number of conditions.

The Matlab and R directories contain README files with more specific details on how to use the functions, and also contain example scripts demonstrating use of the functions.

Example data suitable for use with these functions can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.7488/ds/2214.
